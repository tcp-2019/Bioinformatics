# What's Bioinformatics
## Bioinformatics is the application of computer science and information technology to the field of biology.The primary goal of bioinformatics is to increase the understanding of biological processes. What sets it apart from other approaches, however, is its focus on developing and applying computationally intensive techniques (e.g., pattern recognition, data mining, machine learning algorithms, and visualization) to achieve this goal.
# Why am I learn Bioinformatics
